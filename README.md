# OpenVB for Rust
An implementation of the [OpenVBconf standard](https://github.com/ExpressiveLabs/OpenVBconf) for singing voice library configuration in pure Rust. This library is maintained by the Language Support team at ExpressiveLabs and will be updated with the newest additions to the OpenVBconf standard as time goes on.

## What is OpenVBconf?
The `oto.ini` file standard, used by community-backed singing synthesizers such as UTAU and OpenUTAU, is aging and slowly becoming obsolete on modern platforms. To provide a future-proof alternative, [ExpressiveLabs](https://expressivelabs.net/) created a new standard in collaboration with industry professionals and long-term users. This standard, [OpenVBconf](https://github.com/ExpressiveLabs/OpenVBconf), is dedicated to the public domain in hopes many projects and users adopt it.

If you have questions, concerns, or feature ideas, feel free to bring them to the attention of the ExpressiveLabs Language Support team. You can reach them via [language.teams@expressivelabs.net](mailto:language.teams@expressivelabs.net).
